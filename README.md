## What is full stack? What's a full stack engineer?

Let say everything from the client all the way up to the server, which is someone who can build an application from start to finish

Almost impossible to be good at every part of the stack. You can be good at the front-end, you can be good at probably some of the back-end. You might be good at databases. You might be good at security. You might be good at performance tuning.

## Why Full Stack

You can master all the techniques involved in a development project. You can make a prototype very rapidly. You can provide help to all the team members.

Full stack developers ensure the openness of application and they also work alongside graphic designers as well for features of web design and many other tasks. They are necessary to look into web projects from the start to its final form.

## Command Line

Every operating system have command line, whether its windows, mac or linux. Its consistent, the command line always gonna be the same.

- Fast
- Consistent
- Easier to automate

Command line are important because not all server have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) and theres no limitation, no matter how well designed the GUI you cannot encompass all the possibilities. Some example of more familiar command line :

- `cd` - change directory
- `ls` - list directory content
- `pwd` - print working directory
- `mkdir` - make directory
- `rmdir` - remove directory
- `cat` - show file contents
- `man` - command manual
- `less` - show file contents by page
- `rm` - remove file
- `echo` - repeat input

### Shells

Is the one that included with a lot of UNIX systems by default but it basically allows you to run command lines, and run a lot of the basic systems that come along with UNIX.

- shells - Command intepreter to interface with systems
- terminal - runs shells application

The shells is just a frontline that is the user interface of some sorts, and it just talk to the application or the OS which talk to the kernel, and the kernel is the core of operating system.
